This is a demo scenario for video. 2 drones and 4 pipucks form a formation

The camera will follow a track to generate movie like video

To run this experiment : `python3 build/experiments/exp_xxx/run.py -r 1 -l 1000`
run.py will generate a sons.argos file and run command argos3 -c sons.argos automatically
where -r and -l are optional,
-r means the random seed, if not given, the current time is used,
-l means the experiment length, if not given, the one set in run.py is used.
