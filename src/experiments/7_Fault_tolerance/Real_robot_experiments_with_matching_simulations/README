In this scenario, the swarm will do the formation switch with the tunnel scenario (exp_0_hw_04_switch_line). However, there will be a certain percentage of the robots fail in the middle.
The failure happens at step 500.

To run this experiment : `python3 build/experiments/exp_xxx/run.py -r 1 -l 1000`
run.py will generate a sons.argos file and run command argos3 -c sons.argos automatically
where -r and -l are optional,
-r means the random seed, if not given, the current time is used,
-l means the experiment length, if not given, the one set in run.py is used.
