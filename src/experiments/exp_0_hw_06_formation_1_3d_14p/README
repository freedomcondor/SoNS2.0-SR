This scenario is a simple formation case same as exp_0_hw_01_formation_1_2d_10p, but with 3 drones and 14 pipucks.
robots scatter randomly in the beginning. In the end, the swarm forms the following formation 

(p for pipuck, d for drone)

             p         p         p
        p         p         p         p
             d         d         d
        p         p         p         p
             p         p         p

To run this experiment : `python3 build/experiments/exp_xxx/run.py -r 1 -l 1000`
run.py will generate a sons.argos file and run command argos3 -c sons.argos automatically
where -r and -l are optional,
-r means the random seed, if not given, the current time is used,
-l means the experiment length, if not given, the one set in run.py is used.
