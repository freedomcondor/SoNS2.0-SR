In this scenario, the swarm is trying to form a formation with 2 drones and 6 pipucks.

But the inital position of the robots are highly clustered. We want to see that the swarm has the ability to 
scatter around and form the formation.

To run this experiment : `python3 build/experiments/exp_xxx/run.py -r 1 -l 1000`
run.py will generate a sons.argos file and run command argos3 -c sons.argos automatically
where -r and -l are optional,
-r means the random seed, if not given, the current time is used,
-l means the experiment length, if not given, the one set in run.py is used.
