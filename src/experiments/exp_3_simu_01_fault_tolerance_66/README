In this scenario, we do the same as exp_1_simu_04_switch_line. (The tunnel one)

But we fail 66% of the robots at the 1000th step. The rest of the robots should restore the SoNS and the formation and keep move through the tunnel.

We do three sub tasks:

     1. We fail 66% of all the robots
     2. We fail 66% of only the drones
     2. We fail 66% of only the pipucks

To change this, change common.lua line 305 from:

	if vns.api.stepCount == 1000 and robot.random.uniform() < 0.66 then

to: 

	if vns.api.stepCount == 1000 and robot.random.uniform() < 0.66 and vns.robotTypeS == "drone" then

or

	if vns.api.stepCount == 1000 and robot.random.uniform() < 0.66 and vns.robotTypeS == "pipuck" then


To run this experiment : `python3 build/experiments/exp_xxx/run.py -r 1 -l 1000`
run.py will generate a sons.argos file and run command argos3 -c sons.argos automatically
where -r and -l are optional,
-r means the random seed, if not given, the current time is used,
-l means the experiment length, if not given, the one set in run.py is used.
