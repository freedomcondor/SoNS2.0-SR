In this case, the swarm is supposed to form a formation with 2 drones and 6 pipucks, and sweep the area from one side to the other.
1. First they form the following formation from random positions

            p   p
              d
            p   p
              d
            p   p             (d: drone, p: pipuck)

2. Then they start to move, and move through a field with randomly placed obstacles.
   Each robot avoid these obstacles locally.

3. When they reach the wall with two gates, the swarm senses the gates and chooses the larger gate. 
   To move through the gate, the robot that is in front of the larger gate becomes the new brain, and lead the swarm to switch to the second formation.

            p   p   p
              d   d
            p   p   p

4. After the gate, when they see the target behind the gate, they switch to the last formation to surround it.

                    p
              d  p
               p    TTT
               p    TTT
              d  p
                    p          (T: target)

To run this experiment : `python3 build/experiments/exp_xxx/run.py -r 1 -l 1000`
run.py will generate a vns.argos file and run command argos3 -c vns.argos automatically
where -r and -l are optional,
-r means the random seed, if not given, the current time is used,
-l means the experiment length, if not given, the one set in run.py is used.
