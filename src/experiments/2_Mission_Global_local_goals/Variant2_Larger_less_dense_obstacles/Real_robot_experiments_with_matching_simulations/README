In this scenario, there are 2 drones and 6 pipucks, the swarm firstly form a formation, then sweep a field scattered with LARGE obstacles, and last stop in front of an end marker.

         p     p                oo           (o: obstacles, e: end marker)

To run this experiment : `python3 build/experiments/exp_xxx/run.py -r 1 -l 1000`
run.py will generate a sons.argos file and run command argos3 -c sons.argos automatically
where -r and -l are optional,
-r means the random seed, if not given, the current time is used,
-l means the experiment length, if not given, the one set in run.py is used.
