 This is analyze the performance of the swarm when the size scaling up.

The swarm will simply do a chain formation with each knot contains 3 drones and 12 pipucks

In the run.py of this scenario, we abuse -l option as the number of drones
`python3 run.py -r 1 -l 1` means run with random seed 1, and the swarm size is 1 drone 4 pipucks

We iterate -l from 1 to 25, and measure the formation error, calculation time, etc. See the paper for details
