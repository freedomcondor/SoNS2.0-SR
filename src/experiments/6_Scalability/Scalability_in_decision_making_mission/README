 This is scalability case for exp_0_hw_05_gate_switch

 The swarm forms a line, moves in front of a wall with two gates, and chooses the larger one to move through, and at last surrounds a target behind it.

We do this for differenct scales of swarm. We do it with :

scale      drone       pipuck
  1          7           28
  2          13          52
  3          19          76
  4          25          100

To switch scales, adjust line 8 in run.py

To run this experiment : `python3 build/experiments/exp_xxx/run.py -r 1 -l 1000 -m 10`
run.py will generate a sons.argos file and run command argos3 -c sons.argos automatically
where -r -l, -m are optional,
-r means the random seed, if not given, the current time is used,
-l means the experiment length, if not given, the one set in run.py is used.

-m X means to run in X threads in parallel
