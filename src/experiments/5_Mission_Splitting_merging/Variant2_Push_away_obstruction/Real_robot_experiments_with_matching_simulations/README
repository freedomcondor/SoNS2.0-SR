In this scenario, the swarm is trying to form a formation with 1 drones and 4 pipucks.

         p     p
            d   
         p     p

However, when starting, one of the pipucks is trapped by obstacles


               p                               o
            d                               o  p o  
         p     p                               o

The swarm will switch formations to push the obstacle away to rescue the trapped pipuck out

                                               o
                                            o  p o
                               push up     ppp o
                                            d


                                            o  o
                                           ppp p o
                                            d  o


                                            o  o
                                      ppp p      o
                                       d       o


                              p   p         o  o
                                d                o
                              p   p            o

To run this experiment : `python3 build/experiments/exp_xxx/run.py -r 1 -l 1000`
run.py will generate a sons.argos file and run command argos3 -c sons.argos automatically
where -r and -l are optional,
-r means the random seed, if not given, the current time is used,
-l means the experiment length, if not given, the one set in run.py is used.
