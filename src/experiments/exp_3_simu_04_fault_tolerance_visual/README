In this scenario, we do the same as exp_1_simu_04_switch_line. (The tunnel one)

But at the 500th step, the drone camera will be blocked for a short period of time. This means all the robot will not be able to detect the location of each other.
The SoNS will restore connection after that and keep going through the tunnel.

We do:

1. A visual cut for 0.5s
  
         In this case, 0.5 second is shorter than SoNS break tolerance time, so the connections between robots will remain, the mns will go on as if nothing has happened.

2. A visual cut for 1s
  
         In this case, 1 second is just longer than SoNS break tolerance time. 
         All the connections between robots will break, the robots will re-recruit each other, but may in a differenct topology because the recruitment is random. 
         and re-form the formation, and keep going through the tunnel.

3. A visual cut for 30s

         In this case, wifi cut for 30 seconds. The SoNS will break and all the robots will drift for 30s, and then restore.

To change the time in the code, change common.in.lua line 292 from :

	if 500 < api.stepCount and api.stepCount <= 502 then

to (0.5s):
	if 500 < api.stepCount and api.stepCount <= 502 then     (In simulation, 1s = 5 steps)

to (1s):
	if 500 < api.stepCount and api.stepCount <= 505 then  

to (30s):
	if 500 < api.stepCount and api.stepCount <= 650 then  


To run this experiment : `python3 build/experiments/exp_xxx/run.py -r 1 -l 1000`
run.py will generate a vns.argos file and run command argos3 -c vns.argos automatically
where -r and -l are optional,
-r means the random seed, if not given, the current time is used,
-l means the experiment length, if not given, the one set in run.py is used.
