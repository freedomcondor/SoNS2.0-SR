This is a simple formation case, but with 10 drones.
Robots scatter randomly in the beginning. In the end, the swarm is supposed to form a formation with 10 drones and 40 pipucks.

To run this experiment : `python3 build/experiments/exp_xxx/run.py -r 1 -l 1000`
run.py will generate a vns.argos file and run command argos3 -c vns.argos automatically
where -r and -l are optional,
-r means the random seed, if not given, the current time is used,
-l means the experiment length, if not given, the one set in run.py is used.
