The scenario looks like the same with exp_0_hw_04_switch_line, but with 10 drones and 40 pipucks:

                          ooo

                          ooo                   

The swarm tries to move through this tunnel which is getting narrower and narrower.
The swarm switches formation for two times to adapt to the width of the tunnel.

To run this experiment : `python3 build/experiments/exp_xxx/run.py -r 1 -l 1000`
run.py will generate a vns.argos file and run command argos3 -c vns.argos automatically
where -r and -l are optional,
-r means the random seed, if not given, the current time is used,
-l means the experiment length, if not given, the one set in run.py is used.
